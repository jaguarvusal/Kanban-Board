# Kanban Board Application  
**Live Demo:** 

This is a secure Kanban task management application with user authentication powered by JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users can log in, manage tasks in a Kanban-style interface, and maintain authenticated sessions for streamlined productivity. Unauthorized access is blocked, and sessions expire automatically after inactivity to ensure security.
